# Health Awareness Analysis

This project collects both structured and semi-structured data via HTML from the web and uses it for analysis.


# Replication Steps

To successfully replicate the results here please download all the files and ensure that the files are on the same PATH as the code itself to mitigate any issues of opening it up.

The semi-structured data was scrapped from the CDC site back in 2021, so the numbers may have changed here, so I would recommend using the rankerDF.csv file provided here rather than scraping off the internet again for it.

The report is also included in this repo for ease of access.

In addition, please make sure to have the following Python packages installed prior to running the code:


**urllib**


**bs4**


**pandas**


**tabulate**


# Learning Goals
