# College Football Coach Salary Analysis

This project allowed me to use different data sets off the internet and practice my skill in data cleaning and merging on similar college names. It could be done via a manual way, but I proceeded to doing it the challenging way because in the real world, we often may get data sets that are over 10k observations and manual cleaning won't be effective there at all.
