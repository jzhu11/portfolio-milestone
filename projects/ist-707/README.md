# Housing Value Analysis within Staten Island 

This project helped me define and apply a broad range of data science strategies from identifying a problem to finding a solution for it.

# Replicat Steps

This one would be quite simple since the main project was done via RWeka. 

Ensure you have RWeka installed, and you can open up the file(Final_Train_Data_Weka.arff) that was provided since all the data cleaning should be done there.

NOTE: All models except for the KNN one can be replicated now for some odd reason. 
Overall it won't affect the final conclusion of the assignment and the model that was chosen(SVM)

# Learning Goals

-Describe a broad overview of the major practice areas in data science

-Develop alternative strategies based on the data
