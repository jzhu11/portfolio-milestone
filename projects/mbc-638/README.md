# Operation Sleep Enough!

This project allowed me to learn how to identify a problem all the way to devising an implementation plan for it.

I was able to find out how to collect data since the topic was on my sleep time, and use that data to create statistical analysis and finding the most signficant variable in increasing my total sleep time.

An implementation plan was also created after going through different steps of analysis.

This isn't a code, nor does it require additional software to view. If you don't have the Microsoft Office Suite installed, I would recommend using the G-Suite to view these items.

I also attached the data set here for visibility.

# Learning Goals

-Identify patterns in data via visualization, statistical analysis, and data mining

-Develop a plan of action to implement the business decisions derived from the analyses
